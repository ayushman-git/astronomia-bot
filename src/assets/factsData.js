    title: "Hot ice is a thing",
    description:
      "At 33 light-years away is an exoplanet called Gliese 436 b. The planet is composed of different water elements, which form burning ice. In other words, the ice on the planet remains solid due to pressure, while the extreme surface temperature of 570° F (300° C) super-heats the water, causing it to come off as steam.",

  {
    title: "Uranus is tilted on its side",
    description:
      "Uranus appears to be a featureless blue ball upon first glance, but this gas giant of the outer solar system is pretty weird upon closer inspection. First, the planet rotates on its side for reasons scientists haven't quite figured out. The most likely explanation is that it underwent some sort of one or more titanic collisions in the ancient past. In any case, the tilt makes Uranus unique among the solar system planets.",
  },
  {
    title: "Jupiter's moon Io has towering volcanic eruptions",
    description:
      "Io's eruptions come from the immense gravity the moon is exposed to, being nestled in Jupiter's gravitational well. The moon's insides tense up and relax as it orbits closer to, and farther from, the planet, generating enough energy for volcanic activity. Scientists are still trying to figure out how heat spreads through Io's interior, though, making it difficult to predict where the volcanoes exist using scientific models alone.",

  {
    title: "Enceladus, one of Saturn’s smaller moons, reflects 90% of the Sun’s light",
    description:
      "Because Enceladus’ icy surface reflects sunlight rather than absorbing it, temperatures reach as low as -394° Fahrenheit (-201° Celsius).",

    description:
      "The grand, spiraling arms of the Whirlpool Galaxy are made up of long lanes of stars and gas, sprinkled with lots of space dust. These arms act as star formation factories, compressing hydrogen gas and creating clusters of new stars.",

    title: "A light-year is the distance covered by light in a single year",
    description:
      "Light moves at the velocity of about 186,411 miles (300,000 km) a second. So one light-year equates to roughly 5,903,026,326,255 miles (9,460,730,777,119 km)!",

    title: "The Sun weighs about 330,000 times more than Earth",
    description:
      "It is about 109 times the diameter of Earth and is so large the Earth could fit inside the sun about 1,300,000 times over! In fact, the sun is so gigantic that it contains 99.85% of all mass in our solar system.",
  },
  {
    title: "Footprints left on the Moon won’t disappear as there is no wind",
    description:
      "But wait a minute… if there’s no wind to blow them away then why is the flag blowing? Well, it actually wasn’t blowing. That rippling you see is because of a stubborn telescopic horizontal rod that the astronauts were struggling to remove from the flag’s upper hem.",

  {
    title: "There are 79 known moons orbiting Jupiter",
    description:
      "Jupiter is the planet in our solar system with the most moons, and it also has the largest moon in our solar system. That moon is called Ganymede and is 33,279 miles (5,262 km) in diameter – that’s bigger than Mercury and it is visible with just a pair of binoculars!",
  },
  {
    title: "The Martian day is 24 hours 39 minutes and 35 seconds long",
    description:
      "So you’d therefore assume there are less days in a year on Mars than Earth, right? Wrong! Because Mars orbits the sun slower than the Earth, there are actually 687 Martian days in a Martian year!",
  },
  {
    title: "The Sun makes a full rotation once every 25 – 35 days",
    description:
      "So for us on Earth, one full rotation equals one full day. However, our gargantuan sun takes 25 – 35 Earth days to make one full rotation!",

  {
    title: "Earth is the only planet not named after a God",

    title: "According to mathematics, white holes are possible, although as of yet we have found none",
    description:
      "A white hole is a hypothetical region of space-time which can’t be entered from the outside, although matter and light can escape from within. Basically, it’s the reverse of a black hole.",
  },
  {
    title: "Because of its unique tilt, a season on Uranus is equivalent to 21 Earth years",
    description:
      "Also the 97.77 degrees tilt on Uranus’ axis means that a day there only last 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds.",

    title: "There are more stars in space than there are grains of sand in the world",
    description:
      "There are 10 times more stars in the night sky than grains of sand on the Earth, with 70 sextillion stars being visible from Earth through a telescope. To put that in numbers, 70 sextillion is this: 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.",

  },
  {
    title: "The Earth’s rotation is slowing slightly as time goes on",
    description:
      "This means that days were shorter in the past. This is because of the tidal effects the Moon has on the Earth’s rotation.",

  {
    title: "Outer Space is only 62 miles away",
    description:
      "Although there is no official solid boundary for where space begins, the Kármán line sits at 62 miles above sea-level and is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties or for aerospace records keeping.",

  },
  {
    title: "We always see the same side of the Moon, no matter where we stand on Earth",
    description:
      "This is because the Moon rotates on its axis at the same rate that it rotates the Earth. It’s known as synchronous rotation or tidal locking.",

  },
  {
    title: "Astronauts can grow approximately two inches (5 cm) in height when in space",
    description:
      "This is due to the lack of gravity in space causes the discs between the vertebrae to expand a little. However, this extra height is lost when re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere and being subjected to the Earth’s gravity again.",

    description:
      "Active galaxies often pump out 100 times more light than a normal galaxy. With the discovery in 1963 of quasars, it was clear that the light comes not from stars but from a central region smaller than the Solar System. The only conceivable energy source is matter heated to incandescence as its swirls down onto a giant black hole up to 50 billion times the mass of the Sun. In the 1990s, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope found that, although active galaxies account for only about 1% of galaxies, supermassive black holes are no anomaly. Almost every galaxy, including our Milky Way, contains one, but starved of a food supply, most have switched off.",
