First, the planet rotates on its side for reasons scientists haven't quite figured out. The most likely explanation is that it underwent some sort of one or more titanic collisions in the ancient past. In any case, the tilt makes Uranus unique among the solar system planets.",

Scientists are still trying to figure out how heat spreads through Io's interior, though, making it difficult to predict where the volcanoes exist using scientific models alone.",

    description:
      "Stars are so far away, that they are actually just points of light, which means that when they reach the Earth, due to the changes of direction (known as refraction), caused by the atmosphere, their light doesn’t reach any single point, including our eyes and telescopes, continuously.",
